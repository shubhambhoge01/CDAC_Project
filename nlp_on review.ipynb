Often you'll have live bands playing on the stage, awesome street performers, and even Chippendale guys that pull you in for a sexy photo shoot.  Honestly, with all the very-scantily-clad girls, you might want to avoid this place if you have kids; between that and all the rampant cigarette smoking and drunk people, probably not a good idea to bring family here.  Also, a bad part of town is not far away, so best if you have company with you if you're a single lady.  I haven't tried the ziplining, but would like to at some point.  The overhead LCD screen sometimes has good shows, sometimes meh.  But, it's a quintessential part of Las Vegas history.

So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.

If you haven't seen this show in a while, then come back and check it out - apparently it changes pretty frequently, so it can be a fresh experience if you see it from time to time.  I was expecting to have a good time, but if you let yourself get caught up in it, you'll be like me and have an absolute blast!  There's plenty of audience participation stuff, which only adds to the fun of the experience.  Can't wait to come back and see them again!\n",

Nancy had no idea what she was doing( left big patches, twisted my arm in very hurtful unnatural ways, had to ask for hot towel after she used Wax remover lotion) but the kicker was she dripped wax all over my pants.

Not on the menu.... I explained that was illegal as it wasn't on the menu and I was not told... He agreed to give me $5 back.  Then I showed him the huge stain on my pants and he said \"sorry, sometimes that happens\".  I said that she should have paid attention or draped me better.  I was on vacation and was going to have to buy a new pair of pants because of this and I needed to be compensated.....he finally agreed that if I brought back a receipt for new pants he'd reimburse me.

We ordered at 5:45, waited for delivery guy at 6:40, only to open our bags to find half the order was in the bag. Called the store, and passed around to 3 people before someone could even talk about the problem constructively. No sense of how to resolve a customer's problem at all!  We asked to speak to manager and were told they have no way to get in touch with them (red flag). Big fat lie! Given the usual excuses of \"we are so busy\" \"only one delivery guy\" \"no manager here\". Told them it's obvious you have no manager because then we wouldn't have this problem of an incomplete order. Officially our order was not delivered complete until 7:25.  \n",

Maybe that explains why they want to bill you ahead of time before services are rendered. I told him from the beginning, I do not pay for something I have not received yet.
